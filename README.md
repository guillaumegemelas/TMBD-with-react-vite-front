### First part of the page

A lot of information such as the platform on which the game was released, the type of game, the average rating of critics, a summary of the game, and more.

### Second part of the page

You have 5 games similar to the chosen game. You can click on them to get more details.

### Third part of the page

You have reviews of the game left by connected people, but you cannot see the ratings if you are not connected. You will also need to log in or create an account if you don't have one to leave a comment or rating on a game. The same goes if you want to add a game to your favorites.
